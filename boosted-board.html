									<strong>CAMPUSTOWN, IL</strong> — Zooming down East Green during his local commute to the Thomas M. Siebel Center for Computer Science, local student Gregory Chu has been reported thinking he looks really cool on his Boosted Board. “Look at all these people,” Chu said, “They’re probably thinking about how cool I am. I’m so glad my mom agreed to spend 1200$ dollars on this one. It goes really well with these shades too.” Mr.Chu was also spotted rocking his black Nike fingerless sports gloves, despite there being no visible need for him to do so.</p><p>Mr.Chu was gracious enough this afternoon to sit with us for a one-on-one interview during one of the few ten-minute breaks he receives in between walking to CS classes. We sat outside Einstein’s Bros. Bagel shop, where Mr.Chu ordered a bagel with cream cheese, saying they tasted exactly like they do in the Big Apple, where he claimed he was from.<sup>1</sup> </p><p>When asked why, of all modes of transportation available to him, he chooses to ride the Boosted Board, Mr.Chu replied in a 4 minute long tirade about all the benefits Boosted Boards have over Bicycles, remarking near the end of ever sentence, “it’s totally more than just for looking cool, bro.” After ordering his bagel and ranting about how he only rides his Boosted Board for its “functionality,” Mr.Chu remarked that he was already late for class and, Boosted Board in hand, ran to the nearby lecture hall.</p></p><sup>1</sup> further reporting by The Maize Report has uncovered that Mr.Chu actually lived his whole life in Poughkeepsie, a small town in New York State, and had only visited New York City twice.
