									It has been brought to my attention by faculty and parents alike that the lifestyle choices of our students are not indicative of our university’s once high standards. </p><p>It is my unfortunate obligation to report that UIUC students have become fucking pussies.</p><p>They are unable to cram for exams the morning of, losing their stomach after three beers, and losing every other game of competitive League to University of Iowa. I mean, for shit’s sake, UI? Really guys? As we are a campus that cares very deeply for its students and their ability to learn how to be true Alpha Frat Stars, we will be introducing a few new courses starting spring 2019 to aid students in mending these issues.</p><p>Among these will be: Sleep 100, 200, 300, 400, and Sleep 500 (Advanced topics in slumber and the Classical Spanish Siesta). These classes will help student learn to get the extra sleep they need during those useless classes of theirs. </p><p>In Cramming 100, students will be given three days to study for an exam they are told nothing about. Gaming 100 through 300 will teach students that they can achieve all their dreams by becoming top-tier League players.</p><p>In ALC 101, students will be taught the proper way to drink like real partiers and hold their liquor instead of puking it all up. ALC 101 will also be joined by a lab class, ALC 103, where students will be given the opportunity to test (and taste) various forms of Jungle Juice. This class is a once in a lifetime opportunity, as it is taught by UIUC alumnus and world renowned Jungle Juice expert and connoisseur, Leopold Prescott Chad Sinclair.</p><p>Students will have the option to opt out of these classes, should they feel that they will not help. Ask your advisor about getting your shit together and acting like a decent human being rather than wasting four years and hundreds of thousands of dollars of your family’s money on being a degenerate piece of trash.
